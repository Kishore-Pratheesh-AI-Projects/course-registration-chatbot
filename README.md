# Curriculum Compass

Curriculum Compass is a conversational AI chatbot designed to assist Northeastern University graduate students with course registration. The chatbot leverages the latest information about available courses, faculty profiles, and student feedback to help students make informed decisions during the registration process.

## Features

1. **Course Information Retrieval**: Provides accurate, up-to-date information about available graduate courses.
2. **Faculty Profiles**: Summarizes key details about faculty members to assist students in selecting suitable instructors.
3. **Student Feedback Summaries**: Offers concise, constructive summaries of previous students' reviews of courses and instructors.
4. **Guided Decision-Making**: Ensures students receive relevant and factual responses to aid their course selection.
5. **Professional and Neutral Tone**: Handles criticism in reviews diplomatically, focusing on constructive aspects.
6. **Context Validation**: Uses a RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant information and avoids responding with unrelated context.

## How It Works

- Curriculum Compass uses advanced conversational AI techniques to interpret student queries and provide relevant answers.
- A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline ensures responses are based on the latest and most relevant course data.
- The chatbot emphasizes factual accuracy, avoiding speculation or unsupported claims.

## Goals
